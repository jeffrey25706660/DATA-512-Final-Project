# Discrimination In the United States: Experiences of Asian Ethnic Group in the City of Austin

## Abstract
Asian American is the fastest-growing racial group in the United States according to the research by Pew Research Center. The City of Austin in Texas is no exception. According to the data released by the government of Austin, the number of Asians in Austin is doubling every 10 years compared with the general population which doubles every 20 to 25 years. Yet, the majority of the group is still immigrants. Once here, Asian immigrant families face many obstacles, such as language barriers, culture shock, and ongoing adjustments to new lives. One of the most prevalent issues that most immigrants face is racism and discrimination. Many studies have found that racism has been associated with increased risk of health and lower satisfaction of life. The survey conducted by the City of Austin collects data from 230 different questions from the Asian immigration group to help us better understand their life experience and the basis of a personal characteristic that causes the immigration group treated unfairly in the United States. The methodology for this project focuses on the mix of descriptive and regression analysis to identify outliers in the data, summarize the characteristics in a meaningful way, and discover the relationship between one or more predictor variables and the response. The key findings from our research show that the respondent's prior experience in racial discrimination does not have a statistically significant relationship with quality of life in the City of Texas. On the contrary, our study indicates that regardless of English speaking ability and income level, a high percentage of individuals from the Asian immigration group still report being discriminated against in any way.
